      <h1>Experience</h1>
      <p>Currently, I am a part time student researcher at the NUS Institute of Operations Research and Analytics.
      As a student researcher, I had worked on a training platform that uses a machine learning algorithm to recommend questions to the user.
      In my year of experience, I had managed to:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop a prototype quiz application using Flask that runs a machine learning algorithm in the backend.</li>
        <li>Develop a learning platform with content management and dashboard features using React, Material UI and Express,
        which reads and performs analytics on data from a MySQL database.</li>
        <li>Implement machine learning algorithms in python.</li>
        <li>Model management system to allow for easy deployment of trained machine learning models.</li>
      </ul>
